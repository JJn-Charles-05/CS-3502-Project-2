# CPUSchedulingSim
CS 3502 - Section 01 | Project 2
By: J'adore Jn-Charles | April 28th, 2025
## Project Description
---
This project implements two CPU scheduling algorithms:
- Shortest remaining time first
- Multilevel Feedback Queue

The project also utilizes a GUI to test these two algorithms 
against each other and run them with various numbers of processes.

There are a few sections with debugging techniques commented out, and 
there are some test cases built to test each algorithm's ability to handle:
- Basic Functionalities
- Larger Scale Loads
- Edge Cases

## Getting Started
---
To use this project, please run from the Program.cs file. 

You will be able to input various numbers of processes and see either algorithm's
averages and other details. Once you've run each algorithm at least once, you will 
be able to "Compare!" to produce a bar graph that compares the average Waiting and
Turnaround times.
