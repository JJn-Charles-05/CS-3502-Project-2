# CPUSchedulingSim
CS 3502 - Section 01 | Project 2

By: J'adore Jn-Charles | April 28th, 2025

## Project Description
This project implements two CPU scheduling algorithms:
- Shortest remaining time first
- Multilevel Feedback Queue

The project also utilizes a GUI to test these two algorithms 
against each other and run them with various numbers of processes.

There are a few sections with debugging techniques commented out, and 
there are some test cases built to test each algorithm's ability to handle:
- Basic Functionalities
- Larger Scale Loads
- Edge Cases

## Getting Started
To use this project, please run from the Program.cs file. 

You will be able to input various numbers of processes and see either algorithm's
averages and other details. Once you've run each algorithm at least once, you will 
be able to "Compare!" to produce multiple bar graphs that compare the average Waiting and
Turnaround times, CPU Percentages, and Throughput values in Processes/sec.

You will also be able to run 6 test cases using the provided buttons and compare each
algorithms' ability to handle each test case via the "Compare!" button as well.
